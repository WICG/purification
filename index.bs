Introduction {#intro}
=====================

<em>This section is not normative.</em>

Web applications often need to work with strings of HTML on the client side,
perhaps as part of a client-side templating solution, perhaps as part of
rendering user generated content, etc. It is difficult to do so in a safe way,
however; the naive approach of joining strings together and stuffing them into
an {{Element}}'s {{Element/innerHTML}} is fraught with risk, as that can and
will cause JavaScript execution in a number of unexpected ways.

Libraries like [[DOMPURIFY]] attempt to manage this problem by carefully
parsing and sanitizing strings before insertion by constructing a DOM and
walking its members through an allowlist. This has proven to be a fragile
approach, as the parsing APIs exposed to the web don't always map in
reasonable ways to the browser's behavior when actually rendering a string as
HTML in the "real" DOM. Moreover, the libraries need to keep on top of
browsers' changing behavior over time; things that once were safe may turn
into time-bombs based on new platform-level features.

The browser, on the other, has an fairly good idea of when it is going to
execute code. We can improve upon the userspace libraries by teaching the
browser how to render HTML from an arbitrary string in a safe manner, and do
so in a way that is much more likely to be maintained and updated along with
the browser's own changing parser implementation. This document outlines an
API which aims to do just that.

Goals {#goals}
--------------

*   Mitigate the risk of DOM-based cross-site scripting attacks by providing
    developers with mechanisms for handling user-controlled HTML which prevent
    direct script execution upon injection.

*   Make HTML output safe for use within the current user agent, taking into
    account its current understanding of HTML.

*   Allow developers to override the defaults set of elements and attributes.
    Adding certain elements and attributes can prevent
    <a href="https://github.com/google/security-research-pocs/tree/master/script-gadgets">script gadget</a>
    attacks.

Examples {#examples}
--------------------

```js
let userControlledInput = "&lt;img src=x onerror=alert(1)//&gt;";

// Create a DocumentFragment from unsanitized input:
let s = new Sanitizer();
let sanitizedFragment = s.sanitize(userControlledInput);

// Replace an element's content from unsanitized input:
element.replaceChildren(s.sanitize(userControlledInput));
```

Framework {#framework}
======================

## Sanitizer API {#sanitizer-api}

The core API is the `Sanitizer` object and the sanitize method. Sanitizers can
be instanited using an optional `SanitizerConfig` dictionary for options.
The most common use-case - preventing XSS - is handled by the built-in default
lists, so that creating a Sanitizer with a custom config is necessary only to
handle additional, application-specific use cases.

<pre class="idl">
  [
    Exposed=(Window),
    SecureContext
  ] interface Sanitizer {
    constructor(optional SanitizerConfig config = {});
    DOMString sanitizeToString(DOMString input);
    DocumentFragment sanitize(DOMString input);
  };
</pre>

* The constructor creates a Sanitizer instance.
  It retains a copy of |config| as its [=configuration=] object.
* The `sanitize` method runs the [=sanitize=] algorithm on |input|,
* The `sanitizeToString` method runs the [=sanitizeToString=] algorithm on |input|.

Example:
```js
  // Replace an element's content from unsanitized input:
  element.replaceChildren(new Sanitizer().sanitize(userControlledInput));
```

## The Configuration Dictionary {#config}

The <dfn lt="configuration">sanitizer's configuration object</dfn> is a
dictionary which describes modifications to the sanitze operation.

<pre class="idl">
  dictionary SanitizerConfig {
    sequence&lt;DOMString> allowElements;
    sequence&lt;DOMString> blockElements;
    sequence&lt;DOMString> dropElements;
    sequence&lt;DOMString> allowAttributes;
    sequence&lt;DOMString> dropAttributes;
  };
</pre>

: allowElements
:: The <dfn>element allow list</dfn> is a sequence of strings with
    elements that the sanitizer should retain in the input.
: blockElements
:: The <dfn>element block list</dfn> is a sequence of strings with elements
   where the sanitizer should remove the elements from the input, but retain
   their children.
: dropElements
:: The <dfn>element drop list</dfn> is a sequence of strings with elements
   that the sanitizer should remove from the input, including its children.
: allowAttributes
:: TODO: <dfn>attribute allow list</dfn>
: dropAttributes
:: TODO: <dfn>attribute drop list</dfn>

Note: `allowElements` creates a sanitizer that defaults to dropping elements,
  while `blockElements` and `dropElements` defaults to keeping unknown
  elements. Using both types is possible, but is probably of little practical
  use. The same applies to `allowAttributes` and `dropAttributes`.

Examples:
```js
  const sample = "Some text <b><i>with</i></b> <blink>tags</blink>.";

  // "Some text <b>with</b> text tags."
  new Sanitizer({allowElements: [ "b" ]).sanitizeToString(sample);

  // "Some text <i>with</i> <blink>tags</blink>."
  new Sanitizer({blockElements: [ "b" ]).sanitizeToString(sample);

  // "Some text <blink>tags</blink>."
  new Sanitizer({dropElements: [ "b" ]).sanitizeToString(sample);

  // Note: The default configuration handles XSS-relevant input:

  // Non-scripting input will be passed through:
  new Sanitizer().sanitizeToString(sample);  // Will output sample unmodified.

  // Scripts will be blocked: "abc alert(1) def"
  new Sanitizer().sanitzeToString("abc <script>alert(1)</script> def");
```

## Algorithms {#algorithms}

To <dfn lt="sanitize document fragment">sanitize a document fragment</dfn> named |fragment| using |sanitizer| run these steps:

1. let |m| be a map that maps nodes to {'keep', 'block', 'drop'}.
2. let |nodes| be a list containing the [=inclusive descendants=] of |fragment|, in [=tree order=].
3. [=list/iterate|for each=] |node| in |nodes|:
  1. call [=sanitize a node=] and insert |node| and the result value into |m|
4. [=list/iterate|for each=] |node| in |nodes|:
  1. if m[node] is 'drop', remove the |node| and all children from |fragment|.
  2. if m[node] is 'block', replace the |node| with all of its element and text node children from |fragment|.
  3. if m[node] is undefined or 'keep', do nothing.

To <dfn>sanitize a node</dfn> named |node| run these steps:

1. if |node| is an element node, call [=sanitize an element=] and return its result.
2. if |node| is an attribute node, call [=sanitize an attribute=] and return its result.
3. return 'keep'

To <dfn>sanitize an element</dfn> named |element|, run these steps:

1. let |config| be the |sanitizer|'s [=configuration=] dictionary.
2. let |name| be |element|'s tag name.
3. if |name| is contained in the built-in [=default element drop list=] return 'drop'.
4. if |name| is in |config|'s [=element drop list=] return 'drop'.
5. if |name| is contained in the built-in [=default element block list=] return 'block'.
6. if |name| is in |config|'s [=element block list=] return 'block'.
7. if |config| has a non-empty [=element allow list=] and |name| is not in |config|'s [=element allow list=] return 'block'
8. return 'keep'

To <dfn>sanitize an attribute</dfn> named |attr|, run these steps:

1. let |config| be the |sanitizer|'s [=configuration=] dictionary.
2. let |element| be |attr|'s parent element.
3. let |name| be |element|'s tag name, followed by ''.'', followed by |attr|'s name.
4. if |name| is contained in the built-in [=default attribute drop list=] return 'drop'.
5. if |name| is in |config|'s [=attribute drop list=] return 'drop'.
6. if |config| has a non-empty [=attribute allow list=] and |name| is not in |config|'s [=attribute allow list=] return 'drop'
7. return 'keep'


TODO: To <dfn>create a document fragment</dfn> ...

To <dfn>sanitize</dfn> a given |input|, run these steps:

1. run [=create a document fragment=] algorithm on the |input|.
2. run the [=sanitize document fragment=] algorithm on the resulting fragment,
3. and return its result.

To <dfn>sanitizeToString</dfn> a given |input|, run these steps:

1. run the [=sanitize=] algorithm on |input|,
2. run the steps of the [=HTML Fragment Serialization Algorithm=] with
     the fragment root of step 1 as the |node|, and return the result string.


## Default Configuration {#defaults}

Issue: The sanitizer defaults need to be carefully vetted, and are still
    under discussion. The values below are for illustrative purposes only.

The sanitizer has a built-in default configuration, which aims to eliminate
any script-injection possibility. Note that the [=sanitize document fragment=]
algorithm
is defined so that these defaults are handled first and cannot be overriden
by a custom configuration.


: Default Drop Elements

:: The <dfn>default element drop list</dfn> has the following value:
   ```
 [ "script", "this is just a placeholder" ]
   ```

: Default Block Elements

:: The <dfn>default element block list</dfn> has the following value:<br>
   ```
[ "noscript", "this is just a placeholder" ]
   ```

: Default Drop Attributes

:: The <dfn>default attribute drop list</dfn> has the following value:
   ```
{}
   ```

# Appendix A: Integration with Trusted Types {#trustedtypes}

Issue(WICG/sanitizer-api#20): The best way to integrate Trusted Types is still under discussion.

Issue: The two methods below
  (<a href="#trustedtypes-sanitize-to">`sanitizeToTrustedHTML`</a> and
   <a href="#trustedtypes-createHTML">createHTML</a>)
  are redundant. It is unclear whether both are needed.

[Trusted Types](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-trusted-types/dist/spec/) is
a proposed feature to allow locking down the DOM to prevent cross-site
scripting attacks. Trusted Types is complementary to the mechanisms proposed
here. User Agents that support both, this Sanitizer API and Trusted Types,
require integration between these features.

## `Sanitizer.sanitize` sink. {#trustedtypes-sink}

In Trusted Types parlance, the Sanitizer.sanitize method is an HTML sink, and
thus needs to be guarded by the usual Trusted Types mechanisms.

<pre>
  typedef (DOMString or DocumentFragment or Document) SanitizerInput;
  <ins>typedef ([StringContext=HTML]DOMString or TrustedHTML or DocumentFragment or Document) TrustedTypeSanitizerInput;</ins>

  // In interface Sanitizer:
  DocumentFragment sanitize(<ins>TrustedTypes</ins>SanitizerInput input);
</pre>

## `Sanitizer.sanitizeToTrustedHTML`. {#trustedtypes-sanitize-to}

To allow easy combination of Sanitizer and Trusted Types, the `Sanitizer`
interface gets a new method to create a Trusted Type directly:

<pre>
  // In interface Sanitizer:
  <ins>TrustedHTML sanitizeToTrustedHTML(TrustedTypesSanitizerInput input);</ins>
</pre>

Since this is - naturally - a new sink, it requires a Trusted Types check.
But it clearly makes the sense to use this as a way to create Trusted Types
from untrusted input. To facilitate this, the
<a href="https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-trusted-types/dist/spec/#trusted-types-csp-directive">`trusted-types` CSP directive</a>
gets a new keyword `'sanitizer-api'`. If set, the `sanitizeToTrustedHTML` method
will accept any DOMString input. That is, it will skip the Trusted Types check
and will generate sanitized TrustedHTML instances directly.

<pre>
  // In <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-trusted-types/dist/spec/#trusted-types-csp-directive">trusted-types directive</a>:
  <b>tt-keyword</b> = "'allow-duplicates'" / <ins>"'sanitizer-api'" /</ins> "'none'"
</pre>

## `TrustedTypesPolicy.createHTML`. {#trustedtypes-createHTML}

In order to use a sanitizer from within a Trusted Types policy, the
`createHTML` property of the TrustedTypePolicyOptions is extended to also allow
a `SanitizerConfig` to be used.

<pre>
  // In <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-trusted-types/dist/spec/#typedef-trustedtypepolicyoptions">dictionary TrustedTypePolicyOptions</a>:
  // <ins>(</ins>CreateHTMLCallback? <ins>or SanitizerConfig)</ins> createHTML;
</pre>

This will be used in
<a href="https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-trusted-types/dist/spec/#create-a-trusted-type-algorithm">Create a TrustedType</a>
algorithm as follows:

<del>
  3. Let function be the value of the property in options named functionName.
  4. If function is null, throw a TypeError.
  5. Let policyValue be the result of invoking function with value as a first argument, items of arguments as subsequent arguments, and callback **this** value set to null.
</del>
<ins>
  3. Let `fun-value` be the value of the property in `options` named `functionName`, and switch on its value:
    1. If `fun-value` is `null`, throw a `TypeError`.
    2. If `fun-value` is callable, then Let `policyValue` be the result of invoking `fun-value`
       with `value` as a first argument, items of arguments as subsequent arguments, and
       callback **this** value set to null.
    3. If `fun-value` is a `SanitizerConfig`, then let `policyValue` be the result of
       <pre type="js">new Sanitizer(fun-value).sanitizeToString(value);</pre>
       (An implementation would likely not re-create a `Sanitizer` instance on every call. The difference should not be observable.)
</ins>
