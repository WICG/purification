Introduction {#intro}
=====================

<em>This section is not normative.</em>

Web applications often need to work with strings of HTML on the client side,
perhaps as part of a client-side templating solution, perhaps as part of
rendering user generated content, etc. It is difficult to do so in a safe way,
however; the naive approach of joining strings together and stuffing them into
an {{Element}}'s {{Element/innerHTML}} is fraught with risk, as that can and
will cause JavaScript execution in a number of unexpected ways.

Libraries like [[DOMPURIFY]] attempt to manage this problem by carefully
parsing and sanitizing strings before insertion by constructing a DOM and
walking its members through an allowlist. This has proven to be a fragile
approach, as the parsing APIs exposed to the web don't always map in
reasonable ways to the browser's behavior when actually rendering a string as
HTML in the "real" DOM. Moreover, the libraries need to keep on top of
browsers' changing behavior over time; things that once were safe may turn
into time-bombs based on new platform-level features.

The browser, on the other, has an fairly good idea of when it is going to
execute code. We can improve upon the userspace libraries by teaching the
browser how to render HTML from an arbitrary string in a safe manner, and do
so in a way that is much more likely to be maintained and updated along with
the browser's own changing parser implementation. This document outlines an
API which aims to do just that.

Goals {#goals}
--------------

*   Mitigate the risk of DOM-based cross-site scripting attacks by providing
    developers with mechanisms for handling user-controlled HTML which prevent
    direct script execution upon injection.

*   Make HTML output safe for use within the current user agent, taking into
    account its current understanding of HTML.

*   Allow developers to override the defaults set of elements and attributes.
    Adding certain elements and attributes can prevent
    <a href="https://github.com/google/security-research-pocs/tree/master/script-gadgets">script gadget</a>
    attacks.

Examples {#examples}
--------------------

```js
let userControlledInput = "&lt;img src=x onerror=alert(1)//&gt;";

// Create a DocumentFragment from unsanitized input:
let s = new Sanitizer();
let sanitizedFragment = s.sanitize(userControlledInput);

// Replace an element's content from unsanitized input:
element.replaceChildren(s.sanitize(userControlledInput));
```

Framework {#framework}
======================

## Sanitizer API {#sanitizer-api}

The core API is the `Sanitizer` object and the sanitize method. Sanitizers can
be instanited using an optional `SanitizerConfig` dictionary for options.
The most common use-case - preventing XSS - is handled by the built-in default
lists, so that creating a Sanitizer with a custom config is necessary only to
handle additional, application-specific use cases.

<pre class="idl">
  [
    Exposed=(Window),
    SecureContext
  ] interface Sanitizer {
    constructor(optional SanitizerConfig config = {});
    DocumentFragment sanitize(SanitizerInput input);
    DOMString sanitizeToString(SanitizerInput input);
  };
</pre>

* The constructor creates a Sanitizer instance.
  It retains a copy of |config| as its [=configuration=] object.
* The `sanitize` method runs the [=sanitize=] algorithm on |input|,
* The `sanitizeToString` method runs the [=sanitizeToString=] algorithm on |input|.

Example:
```js
  // Replace an element's content from unsanitized input:
  element.replaceChildren(new Sanitizer().sanitize(userControlledInput));
```

## Input Types {#inputs}

The sanitization methods support three input types: `DOMString`, `Document`,
and `DocumentFragment`. In all cases, the sanitization will work on a
{{DocumentFragment}} internally, but the work-fragment will be created by
parsing, cloning, or using the fragment as-is, respectively.

<pre class="idl">
  typedef (DOMString or DocumentFragment or Document) SanitizerInput;
</pre>


## The Configuration Dictionary {#config}

The <dfn lt="configuration">sanitizer's configuration object</dfn> is a
dictionary which describes modifications to the sanitze operation.

<pre class="idl">
  dictionary SanitizerConfig {
    sequence&lt;DOMString> allowElements;
    sequence&lt;DOMString> blockElements;
    sequence&lt;DOMString> dropElements;
    AttributeMatchList allowAttributes;
    AttributeMatchList dropAttributes;
    boolean allowCustomElements;
  };
</pre>

: allowElements
:: The <dfn>element allow list</dfn> is a sequence of strings with
    elements that the sanitizer should retain in the input.
: blockElements
:: The <dfn>element block list</dfn> is a sequence of strings with elements
   where the sanitizer should remove the elements from the input, but retain
   their children.
: dropElements
:: The <dfn>element drop list</dfn> is a sequence of strings with elements
   that the sanitizer should remove from the input, including its children.
: allowAttributes
:: The <dfn>attribute allow list</dfn> is an [=attribute match list=], which
   determines whether an attribute (on a given element) should be allowed.
: dropAttributes
:: The <dfn>attribute drop list</dfn>  is an [=attribute match list=], which
   determines whether an attribute (on a given element) should be dropped.
: allowCustomElements
:: <dfn>allow custom elements option</dfn> determines whether
   [=custom elements=] are to be considered. The default is to drop them.
   If this option is true, custom elements will still be checked against all
   other built-in or configured configured checks.

Note: `allowElements` creates a sanitizer that defaults to dropping elements,
  while `blockElements` and `dropElements` defaults to keeping unknown
  elements. Using both types is possible, but is probably of little practical
  use. The same applies to `allowAttributes` and `dropAttributes`.

Examples:
```js
  const sample = "Some text <b><i>with</i></b> <blink>tags</blink>.";

  // "Some text <b>with</b> text tags."
  new Sanitizer({allowElements: [ "b" ]).sanitizeToString(sample);

  // "Some text <i>with</i> <blink>tags</blink>."
  new Sanitizer({blockElements: [ "b" ]).sanitizeToString(sample);

  // "Some text <blink>tags</blink>."
  new Sanitizer({dropElements: [ "b" ]).sanitizeToString(sample);

  // Note: The default configuration handles XSS-relevant input:

  // Non-scripting input will be passed through:
  new Sanitizer().sanitizeToString(sample);  // Will output sample unmodified.

  // Scripts will be blocked: "abc alert(1) def"
  new Sanitizer().sanitizeToString("abc <script>alert(1)</script> def");
```

### Attribute Match Lists {#attr-match-list}

An <dfn>attribute match list</dfn> is a map of attribute names to element names,
where the special name "*" stands for all elements. A given |attribute|
belonging to an |element| matches an [=attribute match list=], if the
attribute's local name is a key in the match list, and element's local name
or `"*"` are found in the attribute's value list.

<pre class="idl">
  typedef record&lt;DOMString, sequence&lt;DOMString>> AttributeMatchList;
</pre>

Examples for attributes and attribute match lists:
```js
  const sample = "<span id='span1' class='theclass' style='font-weight: bold'>hello</span>";

  // Allow only <span style>: "<span style='font-weight: bold'>...</span>"
  new Sanitizer({allowAttributes: {"style": ["span"]}}).sanitizeToString(sample);

  // Allow style, but not on span: "<span>...</span>"
  new Sanitizer({allowAttributes: {"style": ["div"]}}).sanitizeToString(sample);

  // Allow style on any elements: "<span style='font-weight: bold'>...</span>"
  new Sanitizer({allowAttributes: {"style": ["*"]}}).sanitizeToString(sample);

  // Block <span id>: "<span class='theclass' style='font-weight: bold'>...</span>";
  new Sanitizer({blockAttributes: {"id": ["span"]}}).sanitizeToString(sample);

  // Block id, everywhere: "<span class='theclass' style='font-weight: bold'>...</span>";
  new Sanitizer({blockAttributes: {"id": ["*"]}}).sanitizeToString(sample);
```

## Algorithms {#algorithms}

To <dfn lt="sanitize document fragment">sanitize a document fragment</dfn> named |fragment| using |sanitizer| run these steps:

1. let |m| be a map that maps nodes to {'keep', 'block', 'drop'}.
2. let |nodes| be a list containing the [=inclusive descendants=] of |fragment|, in [=tree order=].
3. [=list/iterate|for each=] |node| in |nodes|:
  1. call [=sanitize a node=] and insert |node| and the result value into |m|
4. [=list/iterate|for each=] |node| in |nodes|:
  1. if m[node] is 'drop', remove the |node| and all children from |fragment|.
  2. if m[node] is 'block', replace the |node| with all of its element and text node children from |fragment|.
  3. if m[node] is undefined or 'keep', do nothing.

To <dfn>sanitize a node</dfn> named |node| run these steps:

1. if |node| is an element node, call [=sanitize an element=] and return its result.
2. return 'keep'

To <dfn>sanitize an element</dfn> named |element|, run these steps:

1. let |config| be the |sanitizer|'s [=configuration=] dictionary.
2. let |name| be |element|'s tag name.
3. if |name| is a [=valid custom element name=] and if |config|'s
   [=allow custom elements option=] is unset or set to anything other than `true`, return 'drop'.
4. if |name| is contained in the built-in [=default element drop list=] return 'drop'.
5. if |name| is in |config|'s [=element drop list=] return 'drop'.
6. if |name| is contained in the built-in [=default element block list=] return 'block'.
7. if |name| is in |config|'s [=element block list=] return 'block'.
8. if |config| has a non-empty [=element allow list=] and |name| is not in |config|'s [=element allow list=] return 'block'
9. [=list/iterate|for each=] |attr| in |element|'s [=Element/attribute list=]:
  1. call [=sanitize an attribute=] with |attr|'s name and |element|'s local name.
  2. if the result is different from 'keep', remove |attr| from |element|.
10. return 'keep'

Issue: This presently ignores all namespace info, making it impossible to
    support different actions for like-named elements from different
    namespaces.

To <dfn>sanitize an attribute</dfn> named |attr| belonging to |element|, run these steps:

1. let |config| be the |sanitizer|'s [=configuration=] dictionary.
2. if |attr| and |element| [=attribute-match=] the built-in [=default attribute drop list=] return 'drop'.
3. if |attr| and |element| [=attribute-match=] the |config|'s [=attribute drop list=] return 'drop'.
4. if |config| has a non-empty [=attribute allow list=] and |attr| and |element| do not [=attribute-match=] the |config|'s [=attribute allow list=] return 'drop'.
5. return 'keep'.

To determine whether an |attribute| and |element| <dfn>attribute-match</dfn> an [=attribute match list=] |list|, run these steps:

1. let |attr-name| be |attribute|'s local name.
2. let |elem-name| be |element|'s local name.
3. if |list| does not contain a key |attr-name|, return false.
4. let |matches| be the value of |list|[|attr-name|].
3. if |matches| contains the string |elem-name|, return true.
4. if |matches| contains the string "*", return true.
5. return false.

To <dfn>create a document fragment</dfn>
named |fragment| from a Sanitizer |input|, run these steps:

1. Switch based on |input|'s type:
  1. if |input| is of type {{DocumentFragment}}, then:
    1. let |node| refer to |input|.
  2. if |input| is of type {{Document}}, then:
    1. let |node| refer to |input|'s `documentElement`.
  3. if |input| is of type `DOMString`, then:
    1. let |node| be the result of the {{parseFromString}} algorithm
        with |input| as first parameter (`string`),
        and `"text/html"` as second parameter (`type`).
2. Let |clone| be the result of running [=clone a node=] on |node| with the
   `clone children flag` set to `true`.
3. Let `f` be the result of {{createDocumentFragment}}.
4. [=Append=] the node |clone| to the parent |f|.
5. Return |f|.


Issue(WICG/sanitizer-api#42): It's unclear whether we can assume a generic
  context for {{parseFromString}}, or if we need to re-work the API to take
  the insertion context of the created fragment into account.


To <dfn>sanitize</dfn> a given |input|, run these steps:

1. run [=create a document fragment=] algorithm on the |input|.
2. run the [=sanitize document fragment=] algorithm on the resulting fragment,
3. and return its result.

To <dfn>sanitizeToString</dfn> a given |input|, run these steps:

1. run [=create a document fragment=] algorithm on the |input|.
2. run the [=sanitize=] algorithm on the resulting fragment,
3. run the steps of the [=HTML Fragment Serialization Algorithm=] with
     the fragment root of step 1 as the |node|, and return the result string.


## Default Configuration {#defaults}

Issue: The sanitizer defaults need to be carefully vetted, and are still
    under discussion. The values below are for illustrative purposes only.

The sanitizer has a built-in default configuration, which aims to eliminate
any script-injection possibility. Note that the [=sanitize document fragment=]
algorithm
is defined so that these defaults are handled first and cannot be overriden
by a custom configuration.


: Default Drop Elements

:: The <dfn>default element drop list</dfn> has the following value:
   ```
 [ "script", "this is just a placeholder" ]
   ```

: Default Block Elements

:: The <dfn>default element block list</dfn> has the following value:<br>
   ```
[ "noscript", "this is just a placeholder" ]
   ```

: Default Drop Attributes

:: The <dfn>default attribute drop list</dfn> has the following value:
   ```
{}
   ```
